# Nuclear socks (Is it really socks?)

This is a CRUD application for managing socks inventory (that is actually nuclear bombs).

## Worth mentioning

This is a refactor version of the app that communicates with the server from heroku for fetching data.

[Previous version on heroku](https://nuclearsocksls.herokuapp.com/) -> fetching data from here.


**Note: The whole vibe of the app is old school terminal, hence the slow render of info.**
